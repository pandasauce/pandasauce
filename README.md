Whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown, welcome to my GitHub profile.

It's more of a stub really. Since the MS acquisition of GitHub all my personal projects have been hosted at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/pandasauce).

Although I do various software security things for work, I particularly enjoy reverse engineering and breaking embedded systems.

* ðŸ–‹ I occasionally document the things I dig into in my free time at [pandasauce.org](https://pandasauce.org/)
* ðŸ“® You can reach me on Telegram [@pandasauce](https://telegram.me/pandasauce)
* ðŸ—’ Unless you are after my resume; for that try [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgi-boiko/)
    - ðŸ“° A showcase of my reversing skills is avaiable in [this writeup for CVE-2020-7958](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cve-2020-7958-trustlet-tee-attack/)
