Security R&D engineer with 10 years of experience. 6 of them in security consulting and 4 in a mixed software engineering / cybersecurity research (80/20) role. Native Russian speaker of Estonian origin fluent in English.

Currently I work on automating mobile app security testing at industry scale worldwide. This involves maintaining enterprise projects in Python and TypeScript (Frida hooks), with occasional dips into CI/CD land and adjacent infra/projects. There is a fair bit of dealing with low-level Android things too (reverse engineering apps, AOSP deep-dives and forks). As a consultant, I used to deliver penetration testing of all possible flavours, architecture risk assessments and taught cybersecurity training courses e.g. OWASP Top 10. I held the CREST Registered Penetration Tester (CRT PEN) certification while it was relevant to my job.

My hobby projects revolve around hacking whatever game I happen to be into at the time: starting with MU Online hooks (2005-2008), to EVE Online bots (2009-2016), Lineage II antibot and anticheat bypasses (2019-2021), Assetto Corsa CSP KN5 decryption (2024+), as well as decryption and extraction of 3D models from other racing and car-builder titles on PC and Android (2024+). This involves reverse engineering layered protections, developing bypasses or emulators in C/C++ and writing advanced Frida hooks.

I love all things that involve software and deep expertise: from reverse engineering and modifying applications, IOT gadgets and embedded devices to security architecture of country-scale backend solutions. I have extensive experience with Python, C, C++/Qt, IDA Pro, Frida, some TypeScript for Frida purposes, some Java and Kotlin for Android purposes, and elements of DevSecOps in GitLab CI.
